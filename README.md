# interactive-brewery-map
As a consumer, I want to create an interactive webpage for advertizing Breweries for customer acsesibility, so that clients can easily view available properties with images and pricing for rent, as well as have clear contact information for each property. 

This is a webpage for advertizing Breweries using an interactive map, The purpose of this webpage application is to make locating Breweries fast, easy, and affordable with clear pricing and map locations for customers, as well as promoting local businesses through advertizement. 

When the user clicks on a map icon for a brewery location, they are then given contact information for the brewery selected. The user then can contact the owner or employees, see all the contact information and location data for the one selected, and save the Breweries in local storage to re-visit later.
